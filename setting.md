Our house was built in 2009, so is still new in appearance, with a fully enclosed and
secure rear garden for outdoor play, the children will also have use of the designated
play room, living room and downstairs W/C and wash basin.

I have lots of creative equipment, toys, outdoor toys and educational provision for the
children to use, this is rotated frequently and I frequently purchase new and
interesting items that the children can use while they are here. We plan to be busy
exploring, learning and most of all having fun!
