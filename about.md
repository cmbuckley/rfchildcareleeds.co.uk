![Jessica and Becki!](/img/about-profile.jpg){: class="img-thumbnail float-left mr-2" }

Hello and welcome! My name is Rebecca Firth (Becki). I live with my husband Adam who is a Secondary School Geography teacher.

I have a little girl whose name is Jessica who turned 1 year old in March 2019. We live in Morley & are in fantastic proximity to local parks, walks, playgroups and indoor play centres.

From leaving school, I studied a NVQ level 3 in nursery nursing to give me a great qualification in child care. From there I worked as a nanny, before now running my own business working as a childminder, in a safe home based setting, with all the comforts of home, but with a focus on child learning and development.

Providing quality early years childcare and education is something I feel passionate about. I aim to provide a great balance between nurturing and educating your child, to enable them to be school ready and independent and to support their development so that they can reach their highest potential.
